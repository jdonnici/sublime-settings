# Sublime Text 3 â€” Settings

Files containing my [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) settings, themes, and build files.

> On Mac, these are stored in: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`

### TODO

Still to be done:

* Steps for installing ST3, including Package Control
* Steps to identify which packages to install, then install them
* Fonts to be installed
* Steps to clone these settings locally:
    - Close ST3
    - `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages`
    - `rm -rf User`
    - `git clone https://github.com/jdonnici/sublime-settings "User"`
* Installing the `subl` command line tool
